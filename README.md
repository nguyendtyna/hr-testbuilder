This repo is an interactive exercise as an introduction to software testing, offering exposure to [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), a popular JavaScript testing suite. The instructions to complete the exercise can be viewed within the ```index.html``` file opened in the browser.

## Installation
[Pomander](https://github.com/hackreactor/precourse-pomander) will check the code for syntax errors and violations against the style guide before each commit. It uses a pre-commit hook to run staged files through ```eslint``` before each commit. ```eslint``` is a linter that will block commits should there be any syntax errors, or, should the style guide be violated. There are some preferred whitespace style rules that will give warnings but not block commits.

The following command is run from within the repository to install Pomander:

```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackreactor/precourse-pomander/master/bin/install | bash```
